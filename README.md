## Insructions for setup:

###Step 1.
Locate the .env named CONF_THIS_.env and rename to just .env

Open the .env and add the required information after the = sign. If you need help getting a discord bot token

I'd also reccomend adding the afk channel as the restricted channel.

RESTRICTED_CHANNEL_ID=channel_ID
